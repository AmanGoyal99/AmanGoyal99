### Hi there 👋

This is Aman Goyal and I am recent CS undergraduate student 👨‍🎓 from NIT Kurukshetra. I strongly believe that AI 🤖 can play a huge role in solving some of the biggest problems in the world 🌏. My research interests revolve around deep learning and computer vision.
Currently I am assosciated with CMU, MSU and IIIT-Hyderabad for research projects. 

I am mainly interested in the intersection of the following domains with AI:

1. Autonomous Driving 🚗
2. Surveillance 🎥
3. Explainable AI 🧠
4. AI in Healthcare 🏥
5. Robotics 🤖

Feel free to explore my repositories as they contain some cool projects such as :
