### Hi there 👋

This is Aman Goyal and I am recent CS undergraduate student 👨‍🎓 from NIT Kurukshetra. I strongly believe that AI 🤖 can play a huge role in solving some of the biggest problems in the world 🌏. My research interests revolve around deep learning and computer vision.
Currently I am assosciated with CMU, MSU and IIIT-Hyderabad for research projects. 

I am mainly interested in the intersection of the following domains with AI:

1. Autonomous Driving 🚗
2. Surveillance 🎥
3. Explainable AI 🧠
4. AI in Healthcare 🏥
5. Robotics 🤖

Feel free to explore my repositories as they contain some cool projects such as :

- [Intrusion Detection in Low Light Settings](https://github.com/AmanGoyal99/Low-light-intrusion-detection) 🔅
- [Deep learning based COVID-19 Classifier](https://github.com/AmanGoyal99/COVID-19-Classifier) 🏥
- [Facial Images Denoising using Autoencoders](https://github.com/AmanGoyal99/Denoising-Images-with-Autoencoders) 🤓
- [Multimodal Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/AmanGoyal99/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition) 📷 👂
